## Quiz Requirements

**Topic**: {topic}

### Question Design Principles

1. **Evidence-Based Distractors**: Each wrong answer must test a specific student misconception
   - Example: Confusing metaphor with simile, misidentifying character motivation
   - NO "All of the above" or "None of the above" options

2. **Balanced Answer Distribution**: Spread correct answers across A, B, C, D
   - Don't cluster correct answers (e.g., avoid AAAB or DDDC patterns)

3. **Plausible Options**: All four options must seem reasonable to students who haven't mastered the content

4. **Clear Question Stems**: Questions should be unambiguous and test one concept

5. **Year-Appropriate Language**: Match vocabulary and complexity to {year_level}

### Context from Knowledge Base
